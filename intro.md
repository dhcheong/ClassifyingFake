Welcome to **Classifying Fake Job Posting Using Machine Learning Algorithm Book**

This document is a renovated version of my STAT 154 (Machine Learning) Final project at UC Berkeley. The paper will carefully examine job posting data, detailed pre-processing steps, and machine learning analysis with k-fold cross-validation. I decided to recreate my previous project because...

1. **I want to dive deep into the many different algorithms.** The original project only used Random Forest Model and SVM using R, but I want to also try many other algorithms in Python. To record my trials and share the result in Python, renovating my old project into Jupyter Notebook is a necessary step. 


2. **The original project report was written in Google Docs, which is not an excellent way to communicate with the public.** Google Docs has a clear limitation on including computation, which hinders complete communication with the readers. Recreating the project using Jupyter Notebook will ensure that my report consists of narrative and computation.


3. **My current repository makes it challenging to replicate or reproduce my original works.** Reconstructing my GitHub repository is a big part of this renovation project. This reconstruction will enable me to enhance further reproducibility/replicability of the project.

This project would not have been possible without instruction/teaching of many professors at UC Berkeley. 

* Professor Nusrat Rabbee (STAT 154: Machine Learning)
* Professor Josh Hug (DATA 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science) 
* Professor Fernando PÃ©rez (STAT 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science)
