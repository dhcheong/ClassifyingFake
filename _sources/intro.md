Welcome to **Classifying Fake Job Posting Using Machine Learning Algorithm Book**

This document is a renovated version of my STAT 154 (Machine Learning) Final project at UC Berkeley. The paper will carefully examine job posting data, detailed pre-processing steps, and machine learning analysis with k-fold cross-validation. I decided to recreate my previous project because...

1. **I want to compare R and Python and see which is better for machine learning analysis.** The original project was done with R, and I reached high precision and accuracy in making the prediction. However, coding with R was not a pleasing experience. Even though R had excellent analysis packages, I had to spend lots of time understanding each package and confronted many unexpected errors. I realized Python could be a good alternative because it is a universal language with better integration of many helpful libraries for machine learning. The goal of this renovation will be to conclude which language is more precise and productive in making machine learning predictions. 


2. **The original project report was written in Google Docs, which is not an excellent way to communicate with the public.** Google Docs has a clear limitation on including computation, which hinders complete communication with the readers. Recreating the project using Jupyter Notebook will ensure that my report consists of narrative and computation.


3. **My current repository makes it challenging to replicate or reproduce my original works.** Reconstructing my GitHub repository is a big part of this renovation project. This reconstruction will enable me to enhance further reproducibility/replicability of the project.
