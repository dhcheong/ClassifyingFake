# Preface

Job searching can be an incredibly challenging and tedious process. Finding a position and company that is the right fit is hard enough, not to mention the non-negligible amount of fraudulent job listings in the labor market, further contributing to the challenge. As aspiring data scientists and statisticians, we want to combat this problem with our knowledge and tools. 

Here, we will explore the dataset from the University of the Aegean that contains 18K job descriptions with 800 fake. Using the dataset, we plan to construct a highly accurate and precise machine-learning model that can classify the fraudulency of job listings.

Let's get started!
