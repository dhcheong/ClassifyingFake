    "Since we have a relatively small number of fraudulent postings compared to non-fraudulent postings, we want to ensure that both the train and test set have the same percentage of fraudulent as the original dataset. In the original dataset, we have about 5% of fraudulent postings, so we will ensure that the train and test set have the same percentage to keep the representativeness of the train and test sets. We will use an 80%/20% split to ensure that we use the data with the balanced output class to avoid problems like overfitting or underfitting.\n",
